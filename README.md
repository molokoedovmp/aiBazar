# Code Documentation

## Overview

This codebase appears to be for a Next.js web application with various components and features. It uses technologies like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and various UI libraries.

## Key Components

### App Structure
- Uses Next.js app directory structure with routes defined in `app` folder
- Has separate layouts for different sections (main, marketing, payment, etc.)
- Uses server and client components

### UI Components  
- Extensive use of Radix UI primitives and components
- Custom UI components built on top of Radix (buttons, dropdowns, modals, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### State Management
- Uses Zustand for global state management
- React context for theming and other shared state

### Authentication
- Uses Clerk for authentication and user management

### Data Fetching
- Uses Convex as a backend/API layer
- SWR for data fetching and caching on the client

### Editor Functionality
- TipTap editor for rich text editing
- BlockNote for block-based editing

### File Uploads
- EdgeStore for file uploads and storage
- UploadThing for file upload UI

## Key Features

- Document editing and collaboration
- User authentication and profiles  
- File uploads and management
- Dark mode / theming
- Search functionality
- Responsive design

## Inputs

- User authentication credentials
- Document content (text, images, etc.)  
- User preferences and settings
- Search queries

## Outputs

- Rendered web pages and UI
- Edited and saved documents
- User profile information
- Search results
- Uploaded files and media

## Usage

This appears to be a full-featured document editing and collaboration platform, likely similar to tools like Notion. Users can create accounts, create and edit documents, collaborate in real-time, upload files, and organize their information.

The modular architecture allows for easy extension of functionality through new components and API integrations. The use of modern React patterns and libraries provides a solid foundation for a performant and maintainable web application.
